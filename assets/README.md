# Audio Assets for Gravity Guy

For the game to work with sound, please add the following audio files to this directory:

1. **flip.wav** - A short "whoosh" sound when the player flips gravity
2. **hit.wav** - A collision sound when the player hits an obstacle
3. **bgm.mp3** - Background music for the game

If you don't have these files, the game will still work but without sound effects.
